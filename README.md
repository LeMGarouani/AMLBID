# AMLBID
AMLBID stands for **A**utomating **M**achine-**L**earning model selection and configuration with **B**ig **I**ndustrial **D**ata.

Curently, **AMLBID** is a Python-Package representing a **meta learning**-based framework for automating the process of algorithm selection, and hyper-parameter tuning in supervised machine learning. Being meta-learning based, the framework is able to simulate the role of the machine learning expert as a **decision support system**. In particular, **AMLBID** is considered the first **complete**, **transparent** and **auto-explainable** AutoML system for **recommending** the most adequate ML configuration for a problem at hand, and **explain** the rationale behind the recommendation and analyzing the predictive results in an interpretable and faithful manner through an **interactive multiviews artifact**.  

**AMLBID** is an interactive and user-guided framework for improving the utility and usability of the *AutoML* process with the following main features:
 
* The framework provides  end-users *(Industry 4.0 actors & Researchers)* with a user-friendly *control panel* that allows nontechnical users and domain experts (e.g., physicians, researchers) to overcome machine-learning predictive models building and configuring process challenges according to their own preferences.

* The first framework system that automate machine-learning predictive models building and configuration for big industrial data. The tool will enable manufacturing actors and researchers to rapidly ask a series of what-if scenarios when probing opportunities to use predictive models to improve outcomes and reduce costs for various tasks as well as the need of classical collaborations. 

* The framework is equipped with a **recommendation engine**, that provide suggestion of the most appropriate pipelines *(classifiers with their hyperparameters configuration)* through the use of a collaborative **knowledge-base** that grows by time as more users are using our tool.

* AMLBID will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring more than **3.000.000** possible pipelines to find the best one for your data in a **negligible amount of time** and **without** need to a strong **computational budget**.

* Automatically select ML algorithms and hyperparameters configurations for a given machine-learning problem more quickly than current methods with a **computational complexity near O(1)**.

* The first system that automatically and efficiently select ML pipeline and providing the **rational** of the provided suggestion. Existing AutoML tools cannot do this.

* The framework is equipped with an **explanation artifact** which allows the end-user to understand and diagnose the design of the returned machine learning models using various explanation techniques. In particular, the explanation artifact allows the end-user to:
    * Investigate of the reasoning behind the AutoML recommendation generation process. 
    * Explore the predictions of any recommendation in a faithful way, through linked visual summary - textual informations for a higher trust.

* Provide a multi-level interactive visualization artifact that facilitate the models workings and performance **inspection** to address the **“black-box trusting”**.

* Provide a **guidance**, when AutoML returns *unsatisfying* results, to improve to predictive performances by assessing the importance of an algorithm hyperparameters.

## Usage
The `Framework` will help you with:
 - Explaining and understanding your data.
 - Automate the  Algorithm Selection and Hyper-Parameters tuning process.
 - Provide reports from analysis with details about all models (Atomatic-Explanation).
 - Interactively inspect the inner workings of the models without having to depend on a data scientist to generate tables and plots.
 - Provide a guidance, when AutoML returns unsatisfying results, to improve to predictive performances.
 - Increase the transparency, controllability, and the acceptance of AutoML.

It has two built-in modes of work:
 - **`Recommender`** mode, for recommending and building highly-tuned ML pipelines to use in production.
 - **`Recommender_Explainer`** mode, which allow users to inspect the recommended model's inner working and decision’s generation process, with many explanations levels, like feature importances, feature contributions to individual predictions, "what if" analysis, SHAP (interaction) values, visualisation of individual decision trees, Hyperameters inportance and correlation etc.

Curently,supports 08 <a href = "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/"> Scikit-Learn </a> classification algorithms, `AdaBoost`, `Support Vector Classifier`, `Extra Trees`, `Gradient Boosting`, `Decision Tree`, `Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, and `Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier`. 

## Requirements
- scikit-learn
- dash
- dtreeviz
- shap

```python
# Install additional Python requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Examples of use
#### <ins>Mode `Recommender`</ins>:

Below is a minimal working example of the `Recommender`mode .

```python
from AMLBID.recommender import AMLBID_Recommender
from AMLBID.explainer import AMLBID_Explainer
from AMLBID.loader import *

Data,X_train,Y_train,X_test,Y_test=load_data("Evaluation/Dataset.csv")

AMLBID=AMLBID_Recommender.recommend(Data, metric="Accuracy", mode="Recommender")
AMLBID.fit(X_train, Y_train)
print(AMLBID.score(X_test, Y_test))
AMLBID.export('Recommended_pipeline.py')
```
The corresponding Python code should be exported to the `Recommended_pipeline.py` file and look similar to the following:<br/>
*Note that the packages import code is generated automatically and dynamically according to the recommended ML pipeline.*

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = pd.read_csv("Evaluation/Dataset.csv")

X = data.drop('class', axis=1)
Y = data['class']

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

model= DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', max_features=0.5672564318672457,
                       min_samples_leaf=5, min_samples_split=20)
                       
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
score = model.score(X_test, Y_test)

print(classification_report(Y_test, Y_pred))
print(' Pipeline test accuracy:  %.3f' % score)
```

#### <ins>Mode `Recommender_Explainer`</ins>:

Below is a minimal working example of the `Recommender_Explainer` mode.
```python
from AMLBID.recommender import AMLBID_Recommender
from AMLBID.explainer import AMLBID_Explainer
from AMLBID.loader import *

Data,X_train,Y_train,X_test,Y_test=load_data("Evaluation/Dataset.csv")

AMLBID,Config=AMLBID_Recommender.recommend(Data, metric="Accuracy", mode="Recommender_Explainer")
AMLBID.fit(X_train, Y_train)
Explainer = AMLBID_Explainer.explain(AMLBID,Config, X_test, Y_test)
Explainer.run(port=8889)
```
